# Banner Images

Place your banner images in this folder.

## Current Image Requirements:

- **home-banner.jpg** - Homepage banner background image
  - Recommended size: 1920x800px
  - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP

## How to Add Images:

1. Add your image file to this folder
2. Name it `home-banner.jpg` (or update the path in the view)
3. The image will automatically appear on the homepage banner section

## Alternative: Use Configuration

If you want to configure the image path from appsettings.json instead of hardcoding it in the view, let me know!
